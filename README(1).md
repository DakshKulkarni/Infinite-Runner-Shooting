This is how the game looks when it starts.
## What's New
Now you might be wondering as to why there is a gun on the screen, that's because the player will have to kill the randomly spawned enemies in order to increase the kill score.
## Player Movement
There is only sideways movement and jump for the player's movement. The player moves forward by default, there is no option to stop or go backwards. This makes the game more challenging for the player to avoid the obstacles, collect the coins and kill the enemy.

## Player Visuals
Now apart from the keyboard, the player will also have to use the mouse in order to shoot. The mouse can also be used to look around the road to properly aim with the crosshair. But the camera is restricted till some tresholds on the Y and X axes. This is done so as to make sure that player is not looking backwards to kill the enemy that is past them.

### Enemy Movement
The enemy spawned moves periodically from one end of the road to another, so that it is challenging for the player to aim towards the player and shoot.

This is how it looks when the enemy gets spawned.

The coins that are spawned rotates on the place which give it more like a collectible feeling in various games.

### Score & Kill text
Collecting coins increases the score and it is obvious that killing the enemeies increases the kill text.

Both the text updates real-time accordingly.
